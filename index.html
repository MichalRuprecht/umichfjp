            The Flint water crisis began in 2014, after the drinking water source for the city of Flint, Michigan was changed from Lake Huron and the Detroit River to a less costly source of the Flint River on April 25, 2014. This move was prompted by an appointed emergency manager, who trumped the power of elected officials, and the switch was supposed to save $5 million. Months after the switch, government agencies like the United States Environmental Protection Agency tested the water and realized there were high levels of lead in the water. However, the city of more than 98,000 people, majority African American, didnâ€™t know about the dangers of the water because the EPA chose to keep it a secret until the information leaked to residents on January 2, 2015. Even after the Flint City Council voted on switching back to the original water source on March 23, 2015, the emergency manager overruled the decision. It was only on October 2, 2015, over a year later, when Flint residents began to get assistance from the government. Although Flint residents were eventually given bottled water and water filters, the aid stopped on April 6, 2018. <b>Flint still doesn't have safe drinking water.</b>

          <br>Ann Arbor, Michigan—The <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/social-solutions" target="_blank">Center for Social Solutions (CSS)</a> sponsored the Flint Justice Partnership (FJP) on Thursday, October 29. The two organizations hope to work together to advance their mission of water access.

<br><br>FJP was founded two years ago by a group of University of Michigan-Ann Arbor freshmen that wanted to bring attention to Flint and the water crisis. After not being able to find an on-campus organization dedicated to the Flint community, the group decided to start FJP in partnership with the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/mcsp" target="_blank">Michigan Community Scholars Program</a>. FJP is built on the idea of partnerships and long-term, sustainable work. The organization educates students about the water crisis through dialogues, information sessions and social media. They also serve and connect with the Flint community through partner organizations, including Crossing Water, Food Bank of Eastern Michigan and Hurley Medical Center.

<br><br>FJP’s co-chair and U-M LSA junior Quinn Nolan said the group is excited to start this partnership. He added FJP is very thankful for the support they received throughout the process from CSS and Michigan Community Scholars Program.

<br><br>"We're beyond excited to be a part of the Center for Social Solutions family,” Nolan said. “Even during these uncertain times, we're ready to continue and expand our work."

<br><br>FJP was sponsored with the mentorship of CSS faculty and staff, including Director Dr. Earl Lewis, Associate Director Dr. Alford Young, Jr., Project Senior Manager Doreen N. Tinajero, Chief Administrator Melissa Eljamal, and Research Associates Julie Arbit and Justin Shaffner.

<br><br>CSS was <a href="https://news.umich.edu/earl-lewis-to-launch-u-m-center-for-social-solutions/" target="_blank">launched</a> by Lewis in 2018 to address three core areas of social concern: diversity and race, water, and the future of work. Lewis and the CSS team are excited to begin the partnership with FJP.

          <br><br><b><big>About the Flint Justice Partnership</big></b>
          <br>The Flint Justice Partnership at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor aims to serve and connect with the Flint community and educate UM students about the Flint water crisis. FJP partners with multiple organizations to advance our mission. FJP was co-founded by Michal Ruprecht, Lindsay Miles, Quinn Nolan, Emily Welch, and Demetrius Ford in October of 2018.

<br><br><b><big>About the Center for Social Solutions</big></b>
<br>CSS fosters research and collaborations that diagnose and solve critical social problems. CSS believes these solutions rely on diverse perspectives that account for the multi-faceted root causes of these issues. Their founding initiatives—diversity, slavery, water access, and the future of work—approach different aspects of the equality that they believe is necessary to advance as a prosperous democratic society.

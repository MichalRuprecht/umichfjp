          <br>Flint, Michigan—Catholic Charities of Shiawassee and Genesee Counties (CCSGC) received over 80 face masks through a partnership between Flint Justice Partnership (FJP) and the Ann Arbor Sewing Center on Wednesday, May 6. CCSGC gave the masks away to Flint residents in an effort to help residents follow CDC guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic.

          <br><br>“They came just in the nick of time,” CCSGC wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CatholicCharitiesofShiawasseeandGeneseeCounties/photos/a.267359973283740/3275855762434131/?type=3&theater" target="_blank">Facebook post</a>. “We had literally given out our last three when they arrived.”

          <br><br>FJP’s community outreach co-chair and U-M LSA freshman Jon Musai coordinated the partnership. FJP’s co-chair and U-M LSA sophomore Michal Ruprecht also helped start the partnership between the two organizations. The initiative is part of FJP’s new <a href="https://umichfjp.github.io/pages/resources" target="_blank">resource website</a> to help Flint residents find important resources quickly.

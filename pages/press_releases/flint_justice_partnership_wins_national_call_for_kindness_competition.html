          <br>Ann Arbor, Michigan—Flint Justice Partnership (FJP) was awarded the national Call for Kindness grant sponsored by <a href="https://www.rileysway.org/" target="_blank">Riley’s Way Foundation</a>. Riley’s Way challenges teens leaders to apply for the grant, which funds initiatives that strengthen their communities and inspire kindness.

          <br><br>FJP was founded two years ago by a group of University of Michigan-Ann Arbor freshmen that wanted to bring attention to Flint and the water crisis. After not being able to find an on-campus organization dedicated to the Flint community, the group decided to start FJP in partnership with the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/mcsp" target="_blank">Michigan Community Scholars Program</a> (MCSP). FJP is built on the idea of partnerships and long-term, sustainable work. The organization educates students about the water crisis through dialogues, information sessions and social media. They also serve and connect with the Flint community through partner organizations, including Crossing Water, Food Bank of Eastern Michigan and Hurley Medical Center.

          <br><br>FJP’s co-chair and U-M LSA sophomore Quinn Nolan said the group is excited to start the partnership. He added FJP is very thankful for the support they received throughout the application process from MCSP’s Dr. David Schoem, Dr. Wendy Woods and William Alt.

          <br><br>"We're beyond excited to be a part of the Riley's Way family,” Nolan said. “Even during these uncertain times, we're ready to continue and expand our work."

          <br><br>The national Call for Kindness Competition builds on Riley’s Way’s work to empower young leaders to use kindness and empathy to create meaningful connections and drive positive change in the world. Riley’s Way has awarded 22 inspiring teens across the country with up to $3,000 each to fund their projects. In addition to the funding, FJP will join the Riley’s Way Kind Leadership Series, which includes mentorship, professional development and peer-learning.

          <br><br>Riley’s Way’s executive director Dr. Christine O’Connell said supporting teen-lead organizations like FJP is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic.

          <br><br>“Teens across the country are leading the charge to make the world a better place,” O’Connell said. “With all of the uncertainty in the world right now, intentional kindness and empathy matter more than ever. The Call for Kindness fellows are shining examples of kind leadership, and their stories inspire all of us to be better to each other. ”

          <br><br>Riley’s Way’s co-founder Ian Sandler added the organization is excited to partner with FJP and continue FJP’s mission.

          <br><br>“Today, more than ever, we all need a sense of purpose in our lives,” Sandler said. “At Riley’s Way, we find purpose in supporting the next generation of kind leaders by providing them with the infrastructure and support necessary to bring lasting change to their communities. We were incredibly inspired by the flood of applications and by all of the 2020 Call for Kindness winners.”
